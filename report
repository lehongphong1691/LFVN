      Narrative Plan:
      The infographic tells a story starting from a high-level overview (Overall Performance), then drills down into specific performance dimensions (Monthly, Channel, Location, etc.). Each section presents data visually and is accompanied by key insights. The story concludes with specific, actionable recommendations for future campaigns, focusing on Landing Page optimization and strategic budget allocation.

      Visualization Choices (Justification, NO SVG/Mermaid):
      - Overall Performance: Goal: Inform/Compare. Big Number Cards (HTML/CSS) for impact. Grouped Bar Chart (Chart.js/Canvas) to clearly compare Plan vs. Actual.
      - Monthly Performance: Goal: Change. Combination Bar/Line Chart (Chart.js/Canvas) is ideal for showing the relationship between a volume metric (Budget) and rate metrics (costs, percentages) over time.
      - Channel Performance: Goal: Compare. Combination Bar/Line Chart (Chart.js/Canvas) effectively compares budget allocation against multiple performance KPIs for a few categories.
      - Location Performance: Goal: Compare/Organize. An Ordered Horizontal Bar Chart (Chart.js/Canvas) is excellent for ranking locations by performance (% Cost/Disbursement) and is easy to read.
      - Landing Page Performance: Goal: Compare. A Grouped Bar Chart (Chart.js/Canvas) provides a direct, easy-to-understand comparison between two competing entities on multiple metrics.
      - Top Keyword Groups: Goal: Organize/Rank. An Ordered Horizontal Bar Chart (Chart.js/Canvas) clearly visualizes the top-performing keyword groups, making it easy to see the ranking.
      - Audience Performance: Goal: Compare. A Polar Area Chart (Chart.js/Canvas) offers visual variety while still effectively comparing the magnitude of performance (% Cost/Disbursement) across different audience segments.
      - Banner Performance: Goal: Compare. A Combination Bar/Line Chart (Chart.js/Canvas) is used to show multiple KPIs (costs as bars, final efficiency as a line) for a clear A/B comparison.
      - LP Optimization: Goal: Organize/Inform. A diagram built with structured HTML/CSS and Tailwind is used to present a process flow and comparative concepts, avoiding SVG/Mermaid.
      - Key Learnings/Recommendations: Goal: Inform/Organize. Styled lists using HTML/CSS provide a clear, scannable summary of key takeaways and actions.

      Confirmation: NEITHER Mermaid JS NOR SVG were used in this output. All charts are rendered on Canvas by Chart.js. All diagrams are built with HTML/CSS.

                <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> The campaign successfully exceeded its primary goals for Disbursement (+36%) and Qualified Leads (+8%). The total number of leads was slightly below target (99%), which reflects a deliberate strategy to focus on higher-quality audience segments. This approach sacrificed some top-of-funnel volume to maximize final conversions, proven by a Cost/Disbursement ratio that was 26% better than planned.</p>

        <!-- Slide 2: Monthly Performance -->

                <canvas id="monthlyChart"></canvas>
            </div>
            <div class="analysis-text mx-auto">
                <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Performance varied significantly by month. <strong>February</strong> was the most efficient month with the lowest Cost/Disbursement (13.23%), likely due to a smaller, more easily optimized budget. <strong>April</strong> also performed well (22.66%) despite a large budget, driven by the focus on the Simple Landing Page. <strong>May</strong> had the highest Cost/Disbursement (33.60%) due to several factors: budget fluctuations, frequent changes between landing pages, and the fact that disbursement data for May was not yet fully recorded as of early June.</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <!-- Slide 3: Channel Performance -->
        <section id="channels" class="section-card">

            </div>
             <div class="analysis-text mx-auto">
                <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> <strong>SEM</strong> was the most effective channel for driving final conversions, achieving the lowest Cost/Disbursement (19%) despite having the largest budget. While <strong>GPM</strong> delivered the cheapest leads (lowest CPL & CPQL), its high Cost/Disbursement (33%) indicates that these leads were of lower quality and harder to convert into actual loans.</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <!-- Slide 4: Location Performance -->
        <section id="locations" class="section-card">

                <canvas id="locationChart"></canvas>
            </div>
            <div class="analysis-text mx-auto">
                <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> The **Central** and **Mekong** regions were the clear winners, boasting an exceptionally low Cost/Disbursement of only 14%. This is significantly more efficient than the South (32%) and especially the North (45%), which was the most expensive region despite receiving the second-largest budget allocation.</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <!-- Slide 5: Landing Page Performance -->

            </div>
             <div class="analysis-text mx-auto">
                <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Performance was heavily influenced by budget and timing. At first glance, the `Normal LP` appears superior with a 15% Cost/Disbursement. However, this was largely achieved in Jan/Feb with smaller budgets. Conversely, the `Simple LP` was used during high-budget months, especially May, where its performance was impacted by incomplete disbursement data. The `Simple LP` remains a highly effective tool for generating low-cost leads (CPL/CPQL) at scale.</p>

        <!-- Slide 6: Keyword Performance -->

            </div>
             <div class="analysis-text mx-auto">
                <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Out of 25 keyword groups, those with clear intent demonstrated the best performance. Niche product keywords like **"Vay Bảo Hiểm Nhân Thọ" (Loan by Life Insurance)** and brand-related terms **(Lotte Finance)** were the most efficient. In contrast, indirect keywords like "buy car" or "fix house" received little budget from the system due to low relevance to the landing page content.</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <!-- Slide 7: Audience Performance -->
        <section id="audience" class="section-card">

            </div>
             <div class="analysis-text mx-auto">
                <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> **Retargeting** was by far the most effective strategy, yielding the lowest Cost/Disbursement (13.73%). This proves the value of re-engaging users who have already shown interest. Further segmenting the "past performance" audience by gender **(Female)** also proved effective (22.05%). Combining the high-performance audience with a normal targeting audience diluted the quality and resulted in the poorest performance (33.69%).</p>

             <div class="analysis-text mx-auto">
                <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> **Pack 1** significantly outperformed Pack 2. Its creative, which combined authentic imagery of people with clear program highlights, resonated better with target audiences and drove better performance. In contrast, **Pack 2**, which relied only on promotional text, was considerably less effective, resulting in a Cost/Disbursement ratio more than double that of Pack 1.</p>

                        <li><strong>SEM</strong> is the most efficient channel for final disbursement (19% Cost/Disb) despite higher lead costs.</li>
                        <li><strong>GPM</strong> provides the cheapest leads but is least efficient for disbursement (33% Cost/Disb), suggesting lower lead quality.</li>

                        <li><strong>Top Keywords:</strong> Brand ("Lotte Finance") and niche product ("Vay Bảo Hiểm Nhân Thọ") keywords are most effective.</li>
                        <li><strong>Underperforming Keywords:</strong> Indirect keywords ("buy car", "fix house") do not receive significant distribution due to low relevance.</li>
                        <li><strong>Top Audiences:</strong> Retargeting is the most efficient audience (13.7% Cost/Disb), followed by the performance-based Female audience (22.05%).</li>
